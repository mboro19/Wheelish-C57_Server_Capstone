# Wheelish-C57_Server_Capstone

Personal project of mine. Nowhere near finished. 
Meant to be a P2P trading service for small to medium size car dealers.
The hope is to limit the cost of auction fees while still have a rotating inventory.

Utilized React.js on front end, with .Net MVC Core on SQL Server for the back. 
Firebase was used as authentication.
CSS and Reactstrap used for styling. 
If you would like to try the app, feel free to register as a new user, 
or you may use a spoof email login of "sales@wheeldeals.com" & admin123. 

Stretch goals include adding photos uploaded via Cloudinary.
Ability to propose a 1 to 1 trade with other dealers. 
Ability to give a feedback score on a dealer.
General comments section to address common questions. 
Soft delete for vehicles that either arent quite ready or are on hold. 
Delete confirmation is in the works as we speak.
More styling.

Feel free to reach out to me via email mboro19@gmail.com...
Thanks!
